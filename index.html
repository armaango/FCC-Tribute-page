          <blockquote>
            <p>He had that skill of [knowing] have you got to put your arm round someone or have you got to lose your temper to get the best out of them. I remember him having a go at me at half-time and I had the sort of attitude that ‘Right, I’ll show
              him’. And I played well in the second half, so then he quickly knew how I would respond to him losing his temper. That followed me for the next 20 years, so it was a big mistake early on.</p>
